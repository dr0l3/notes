# Useful extensions

- `create extension "uuid-ossp";`
- `create extension "pg_trgm";`
- `create extension "pg_stat_statements";`


# uuid-ossp

Unlocks `uuid_generate_v4()`.

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/uuid-ossp.html

# pg_trgm

Unlocks fuzzy search using `word_similarity`.

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/pgtrgm.html

# pg_stat_statements

Requires a bit of setup in the configuration.

```
# Add settings for extensions here
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'

# Increase the max size of the query strings Postgres records
track_activity_query_size = 2048

# Track statements generated by stored procedures as well
pg_stat_statements.track = all
```

Unlocks the pg_stat_statements view which contains a wealth of good information about queries being executed and how long they take.
