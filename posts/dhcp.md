# DHCP

DHCP is a protocol used to assign IP's to computers in a network.
Its based on multicast and follows a client server paradigm.
Clients will broadcast their need for an IP. Servers will offer IP's to clients and servers will acknowledge the accepted offers.

Linux computers can easily act as both servers and clients.
