# ElasticSearch

Foss offering. Implemented in java which puts it as a quite heavy weight process. An empty database consumes about 500MB of memory.

# Algolia

Entirely cloud based. Horribly expensive if you do a lot of updates.

# Meilisearch

Foss offering. Very inefficient with space. 20 MB empty 350 MB with 20k movies added.

# Typesense

Foss offering. Not the most flexible, but very efficinet at 20 MB empty and 60 MB with 20k moves added.
