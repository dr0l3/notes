- use OrientDB because it seems like a nicer database


Concepts
- Article
    - id
    - Topic
    - Content

Another idea
 - Lets just have regular files

 - We can then parse that metadata and ETL it into a graph database
 - We can then use the graph database to keep track of stuff thats needed
    - Ids and links
 - This means we can leverage grep for search \o/
 - And we can store all the data in git for versioning
 - Shell scripts for simple things like
    - Create a new article
- Meta data field
