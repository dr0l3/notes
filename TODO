PLAN
- use OrientDB because it seems like a nicer database
- Create sync function
    - Parse metadata
    - set up tables
    - set up data import
    - Create visualization



Another idea
 - Lets just have regular files
 - Editing markdown is nice, so lets have it in markdown
 - We can put some meta data somewhere that links to other files
 - Let's shove this into ElasticSearch so we can search easily



Problems to be solved
- Highlighting in code blocks does not work
